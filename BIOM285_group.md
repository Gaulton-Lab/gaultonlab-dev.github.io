## Group presentation overview

*For research/data presentations*:  
**Brief overview of the goals of your study**  

**Description of the data being collected in the study**  
- Sample size, replicate structure (biological, technical etc.)
- Distribution of data if possible to estimate
- Potential sources of unwanted/confounding variation

**Hypothesis being tested in the study**  

**Statistical test(s) used to perform hypothesis testing**  

**Results/interpretation of perfoming hypothesis testing**  

**Consider throughout the presentation concepts from class**  
For example:  
Power  
Multiple test correction  
One/two-sided tests
Assumptions of tests  
Covariates
Biological v technical replicates  
Effect size v significance  
Appropriate tests/models  

 
*For paper presentations*:  

**Brief overview of the study and the main findings of the study**
 
**Description of how statistics were reported in the study**
- Did they report tests used for every statistical analysis, and whether the test was one- or two-sided?
- Did they report p-values as well as effect sizes for their analyses?
- Did they report which type of error bars were used?
- Did they report the number of samples used in each analysis?  Did they specify whether the samples were independent biological or technical replicates?
 
**Description of how data was displayed in the study**
- What types of graphs/plots did they to display the data?
- Were individual data points shown on the plots?
- Were error bars shown on the plots?
 
**Description of study design**
- Was there any information about study design included in the manuscript?
- Were power calculations performed and if not was there any information about how sample size was selected?
 
**Overall thoughts on the use of statistics**
- In your estimation did the authors do a thorough job of reporting statistical analyses?  If not, what more could they have done?
- In your estimation did the authors do a thorough job of reporting their study design?  If not, what more could they have done?
 
*Note*:  some journal families require ‘reporting summaries’ with the manuscript – these are usually provided as supplementary material, and may help you evaluate the manuscript particularly for study design
