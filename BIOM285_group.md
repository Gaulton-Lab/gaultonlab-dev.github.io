## Group presentation overview

<h3>For research/data presentations some things you could describe:</h3>  
  
**Brief background of the research**  

**Description of the data being collected in the study**  
- Sample size, replicate structure (biological, technical etc.)  
- Distribution of data, if possible to estimate  
- Potential sources of unwanted/confounding variation  

**Hypothesis being tested in the study**  

**Statistical tests/models used for data analyses**  
- If using a bioinformatics tool, describe as best you can what test is used by the tool  
  *(e.g. DESeq2 uses a GLM)*  
  
**Results/interpretation of data analyses**  
- Effect sizes/feature importance
- Significance of effects
- Visualization of results and error

**Consider throughout the presentation concepts from class**  
For example:  
- Power  
- Multiple test correction  
- One/two-sided tests
- Assumptions of tests  
- Covariates
- Biological v technical replicates  
- Effect size v significance  
- Appropriate tests/models
- Outliers or other interesting aspects of your data  
  
   
<h3>For paper presentations some things you could consider</h3>: 

**Brief overview of the study and the main findings of the study**
 
**Description of how statistics were reported in the study**
- Did they report tests used for every statistical analysis, and whether the test was one- or two-sided?
- Did they report p-values as well as effect sizes for their analyses?
- Did they report which type of error bars were used?
- Did they report the number of samples used in each analysis?  Did they specify whether the samples were independent biological or technical replicates?
 
**Description of how data was displayed in the study**
- What types of graphs/plots did they to display the data?
- Were individual data points shown on the plots?
- Were error bars shown on the plots?
 
**Description of study design**
- Was there any information about study design included in the manuscript?
- Were power calculations performed and if not was there any information about how sample size was selected?
 
**Overall thoughts on the use of statistics**
- In your estimation did the authors do a thorough job of reporting statistical analyses?  If not, what more could they have done?
- In your estimation did the authors do a thorough job of reporting their study design?  If not, what more could they have done?
 
*Note*:  some journal families require ‘reporting summaries’ with the manuscript – these are usually provided as supplementary material, and may help you evaluate the manuscript particularly for study design
