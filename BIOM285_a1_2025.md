### Assignment 1

**Due: April 11**

**Q1**: <br>
Describe the experimental design and hypothesis testing that you are currently planning and/or performing in your rotations or thesis lab, including:
<br><br>
What are sources of variation in the values you are measuring in your experiments, and what are some ways that you can account for this variation in your study design and statistical analyses?
<br><br>
When performing the experiments, are you using randomization or blinding and if not why?
<br><br>
Are your replicates biological (independent) or technical or both, and what is the independent sample size you are using?
<br><br>
Was the independent sample size of your experiments pre-determined using power calculations (if you donâ€™t know ask someone in your lab, or even your PI) and if not, how was the sample size justified?
<br><br>
What is the hypothesis you are testing, and when evaluating your hypothesis do you think a one- or two-sided test be more appropriate and why?
